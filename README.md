# Programming Assignments for Cryptography I by Stanford University

The programming assignments for Coursera Cryptography I by Stanford University are optional, and are only now being worked on (WIP) after I have finished the course. I'll be using Rust to work on these.

### Week 1: Many Time Pad

Let us see what goes wrong when a stream cipher key is used more than once. Given ciphertexts encrypted with the same stream cipher key, our goal is to decrypt the target ciphertext to get the secret message.

### Week 2: AES in CBC and CTR modes

Implement two encryption/decryption systems, one using AES in CBC mode and another using AES in counter mode (CTR). Given pairs of AES key and ciphertext, our goal is to recover the plaintext.
